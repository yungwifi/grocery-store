# grocery-store
This is a backend for a simple grocery store shopping list app that I created as a code along to help teach the fundamentals of express and node.js to the students at General Assembly. 

To run this backend I recommend you use Postman, however you can test in your browser using a JSON plugin caled JSONview that is available in Firefox and Chrome. If you're not using one of the broswers then you probably dont care about this stuff anyways. 

Clone down the repo and run. 

`npm i ` 

Then run.

`npm run dev` 

and hit that localhost:3000 endpoint.
